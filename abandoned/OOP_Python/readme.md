A simple game that is currently on hold until I finish the tic-tac-toe game.
This is a simple game with characters in rows/columnns to represent different objects.
The player has to avoid objects that will move diagonally, horizontally or vertically across the screen.
At a later stage, I wish to add an AI to learn and move around the screen and avoid objects on their own as part of learning and understanding AI and ML code.
