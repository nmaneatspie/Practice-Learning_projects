This is just to keep a copy of the old traffic light controller team project done in university.
This project was made to be run on one of the SPARTAN-3 chips attached to a board simluating a traffic light intersection.
Unfortunately, the code is to a poor standard (poor commenting and details [revisions, dependencies etc.])
